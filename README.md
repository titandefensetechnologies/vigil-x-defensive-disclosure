README.md Contents: # VIGIL-X: Tactical Combat Triage System – Defensive Disclosure **Author**: Jay Anhalt **Company**: Titan Defense Technologies **Date of Public Disclosure**: April 11, 2025 **Submission Reference**: IDEaS CFP006 – Challenge 3 “Don't Skip a Beat” --- ## Overview VIGIL-X is a wearable combat triage system designed to autonomously monitor, assess, and prioritize injured personnel in battlefield environments where network access is limited or non-existent. It incorporates real-time AI-based decision support, rugged biosensor integration, and long-range tactical communication. This disclosure is being published as **prior art** to establish inventorship and to prevent any future patent claims by third parties on the system or its core components. --- ## Core Components of VIGIL-X ### 1. Smart Compression Shirt - Washable, ruggedized shirt with integrated medical-grade sensors: - **ECG** (e.g., MAX30003) - **SpO₂** (e.g., MAX30101) - **Body Temperature** (e.g., MLX90632) - **Respiration Rate** (e.g., SFM3019) - **IMU/Motion Tracking** (e.g., MPU6050) - **GPS Module** (e.g., u-blox MAX-M10S) - Constructed using Schoeller®, Coolmax™, and MedTex conductive fabrics - Designed for compatibility with tactical gear and PPE ### 2. Embedded Node - Low-power MCU (e.g., Nordic nRF52840) with onboard AI logic (TensorFlow Lite) - LoRa-based communication using 915 MHz SX1262 or mDot modules - Configurable RF, light, and sound emissions for stealth operations - Fully sealed and waterproof ### 3. Medic Dashboard Kit - Rugged Android tablet (e.g., Panasonic TOUGHBOOK A3) - Flutter-based app to display real-time triage status for 2–12 soldiers - AI prioritization engine ranks casualties by criticality - No backend server required; all processing is local ### 4. Deployment Kit - Packaged in waterproof hard case with QR-coded setup guides - Battery powered with rugged strain relief and cable shielding - Designed for rapid field setup by non-technical personnel --- ## Operational Objectives - **Monitor and prioritize multiple casualties** in austere, disconnected combat environments - **Autonomously trigger alerts** without user input or central connectivity - **Reduce triage time and increase survivability** during battlefield engagements - **Enable stealth-mode operation** (disabled RF, light, sound) --- ## Legal Statement This document constitutes a **defensive publication and public disclosure**. It is published under the intention of creating **prior art** and protecting the described technology from third-party patent claims. © 2025 Titan Defense Technologies. All rights reserved.
